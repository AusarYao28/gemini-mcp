## Network Knowledge Base

### IP Address Classes (CRITICAL)
- **Class A**: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255 (8-bit network, 24-bit host)
- **Class B**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 (16-bit network, 16-bit host)
- **Class C**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 (24-bit network, 8-bit host)
- **Loopback**: 127.x.x.x (reserved, not Class A)

### Special Address Ranges
- **Private IPs**: 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x, 192.168.x.x (NOT routable on Internet)
- **APIPA**: 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254 (automatic when DHCP fails)
- **Broadcast**: All host bits = 1 (e.g., 192.168.1.255 for /24 network)
- **Network**: All host bits = 0 (e.g., 192.168.1.0 for /24 network)
- **Default route**: 0.0.0.0/0 (Cisco notation for "any destination")

### Address Types
- **Unicast**: One-to-one (packets to single interface)
- **Multicast**: One-to-many (packets to group members)
- **Anycast**: One-to-nearest (multiple interfaces, delivered to closest)
- **Broadcast**: One-to-all (all devices in broadcast domain)

### Layer 2 vs Layer 3
- **Layer 2 broadcast**: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (MAC address)
- **Layer 3 broadcast**: 255.255.255.255 or network broadcast (IP address)
- **Layer 2 scope**: Single LAN segment (switches don't forward)
- **Layer 3 scope**: Routed networks (routers can forward)

### Ethernet Distance Specifications (CRITICAL)
- **1000BaseT**: 100m max over Cat5e/6 UTP
- **100BaseTX**: 100m max over Cat5/5e/6 UTP
- **10Base2**: ~185m max over thin coax
- **10GBaseLR**: ~10km over single-mode fiber
- **10GBaseSR**: ~300m over multimode fiber
- **10GBaseER**: ~40km over single-mode fiber

### Wire Pair Usage
- **100BaseTX**: 2 pairs (1 TX, 1 RX)
- **1000BaseT**: 4 pairs (all bidirectional)
- **10BaseT**: 2 pairs

### Duplex and Access Control
- **Full-duplex**: Simultaneous TX/RX, doubles throughput
- **Half-duplex**: One direction at a time, uses CSMA/CD
- **CSMA/CD**: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
- **Hubs**: Cannot support full-duplex (shared medium)
- **Switches**: Support full-duplex (dedicated segments)

### Domain Concepts
- **Collision domain**: All devices must listen when one transmits
- **Broadcast domain**: Logical division for broadcast packets
- **Baseband**: Single signal uses entire bandwidth
- **Broadband**: Multiple signals on different frequencies

### IEEE Standards and Technologies
- **802.3**: Ethernet family standards
- **802.3bq**: 40GBASE-T standard
- **1901**: Powerline communication (Ethernet over power lines)
- **802.16**: WiMAX (not Ethernet)

### Technical Conversions
- **Binary to Decimal**: Sum powers of 2 (11101000₂ = 128+64+32+8 = 232₁₀)
- **Binary to Hex**: Group by 4 bits (1111₂ = F₁₆, 1010₂ = A₁₆)
- **Hex values**: 0-9, A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15
- **MAC Address**: 48 bits (6 bytes) in hex format
- **EUI-64**: Insert FFFE in middle, flip 7th bit of first octet (00→02, 02→00)

### Frame Structure
- **SOF (Start of Frame)**: 1 byte (8 bits = 1 octet)
- **MAC addresses**: Source and destination in frame header
- **Frame components**: Preamble, SOF, header, data, FCS

## Common Quiz Patterns

### IP Address Questions
- **"Valid Class X address"**: Check first octet ranges carefully
- **"Private IP"**: Must be RFC 1918 ranges, not routable on Internet
- **"Broadcast vs Network"**: Host bits all 1s vs all 0s
- **"APIPA range"**: Always 169.254.x.x

### Address Type Questions
- **"Unicast"**: Single destination interface
- **"Multicast"**: Multiple specific interfaces (group members)
- **"Anycast"**: Multiple interfaces, delivered to one (nearest)
- **"Broadcast"**: All interfaces in domain

### Layer Questions
- **"Layer 2 broadcast"**: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (MAC)
- **"Layer 3 broadcast"**: 255.255.255.255 or network broadcast (IP)
- **"LAN vs WAN"**: Layer 2 broadcasts stay within LAN

### Specification Questions
- **"Maximum distance of..."**: Usually testing standard specifications
- **"How many wire pairs..."**: Testing cable requirements
- **"What does base mean..."**: Testing baseband vs broadband understanding

### Concept Questions
- **"Collision domain"** vs **"Broadcast domain"**: Different network divisions
- **"Full-duplex"** vs **"Half-duplex"**: Communication direction capabilities
- **Device capabilities**: Hubs vs switches vs routers

### Conversion Questions
- Binary/hex/decimal conversions are common
- Address size questions (MAC = 48 bits, IPv6 = 128 bits)
- Frame field sizes (SOF = 1 octet)
- EUI-64 conversions from MAC addresses

### Standards Questions
- IEEE 802.3 family for Ethernet
- Specific committee standards (802.3bq = 40GBaseT)
- Non-Ethernet standards (1901 = Powerline)

## Error Prevention Checklist

1. **Distinguish question types**: IP addressing vs specifications vs concepts vs conversions
2. **Parse options precisely**: Read exact text from snapshots, avoid paraphrasing
3. **Apply systematic knowledge**: Use IP addressing fundamentals before researching
4. **Verify calculations**: Double-check binary/hex math and EUI-64 conversions
5. **Consider all options**: Eliminate obviously wrong answers methodically
6. **Handle similar options**: When options appear identical, extract exact text
7. **Confirm selections**: Ensure correct options are selected before proceeding
8. **Handle dialogs**: Respond to confirmations promptly

## High-Accuracy Decision Framework

### For IP Address Questions
1. **Identify address class**: Check first octet (1-126=A, 128-191=B, 192-223=C)
2. **Check for special ranges**: Private (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x), APIPA (169.254.x), Loopback (127.x)
3. **Verify host/network interpretation**: All 0s=network, all 1s=broadcast

### For Address Type Questions
1. **Unicast**: One destination only
2. **Multicast**: Specific group of destinations
3. **Anycast**: Multiple destinations, delivered to nearest
4. **Broadcast**: All destinations in domain

### For Layer Questions
1. **Layer 2**: MAC addresses (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF), LAN scope only
2. **Layer 3**: IP addresses (255.255.255.255), can be routed

## Browser Interaction Protocol

- Use MCP browser tools for all interactions
- Take screenshot first to read questions clearly
- Use single clicks for all answer selections
- Handle confirmation dialogs promptly
- Continue until quiz completion

This systematic approach should achieve high accuracy by leveraging networking fundamentals and providing clear decision frameworks for common quiz patterns.
